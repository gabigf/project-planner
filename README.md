A to-do list created using vueJS and json-server. The user can create a new task, edit an existing task and delete a task. They can also view filtered lists based on task completion.

## Tech Stack

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

Open two tabs in the terminal. For the first, paste the following:
```
npm run serve
```

In the second tab:
```
json-server data/db.json
```

You can now go to the local host url in the first terminal tab (should look something like this:  - Local:   http://localhost:8080/ )
